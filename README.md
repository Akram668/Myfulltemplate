Automated testing 
When working on my HTML, I utilized Google Developer Tools to style elements. For each element I added, I would first include the basic CSS in my stylesheet. Then, I used the "Inspect Element" feature in Google Developer Tools to experiment with different styles in real-time. Once I achieved the desired appearance, I would copy the CSS code from Google Developer Tools and paste it into my stylesheet. This approach helped me keep track of the code I was using while refining the styles for my website.
